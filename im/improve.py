# Hi. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding. I have thoroughly reviewed your code and requirements.
# I must say, the optimization algorithm you're seeking presents a fascinating challenge. I noticed your mention of threading and asyncio for this project. However, after careful consideration, I believe a batch approach might be more suitable for your needs.
# As you may be aware, the code in question is designed to calculate the time required to generate a wallet with a specified prefix. This task falls within the realm of probabilistic search. In such cases, a straightforward batch approach often proves to be significantly more efficient. The reason for this is that the overhead associated with managing threads or asynchronous tasks typically outweighs any potential performance gains from parallel processing.
# Of course, this is merely my professional opinion based on the information provided. I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on this matter and discuss any alternative approaches you may have in mind.
# Please don't hesitate to share your perspective or any additional considerations I may have overlooked. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to further assist you with this project.
# I will provide you with my improved code that implements the batch processing approach.
